## What we learned

- UI Design and Styling: By experiencing the process of designing user interfaces using HTML and CSS, we learned how to efficiently apply styles.
- Responsive Design: By experiencing the process of designing the project to be responsive across different devices, we learned how to produce solutions to enhance user experience.
- React Fundamentals: By learning how React components are created, along with fundamental concepts such as props, state, component communication, and lifecycle management, we established a solid foundation for developing React projects.
- Basic JavaScript: While developing the project, we learned the basic structures of JavaScript, data types, functions, and fundamental programming concepts, experiencing how JavaScript can be utilized in real-world projects.
- Version Control (GIT): Throughout the project development, we learned to work collaboratively in different branches as a team, ensuring each work is done in an isolated manner. By merging different branches, we facilitated collaboration among team members and coordinated the project's development process.
