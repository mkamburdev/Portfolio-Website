# With a 14-month intensive full-time training program as a Full-Stack Developer at [DCI (Digital Career Institute)](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/) and a great passion for web development, I am excited about the opportunity to become part of your team and support your company with innovative and user-friendly web solutions.
<br />

# At the end of 2021, I moved to Germany and subsequently started the integration process. I participated in B1 and B2 professional German courses. Since I wanted to learn modern technologies and develop myself in this field, I decided to pursue full-time training as a Full-Stack Developer at DCI.
<br />

# During my time at DCI, I voluntarily took part in the [Fellow Program](https://fellow.digitalcareerinstitute.org/) as a Senior Fellow, where I supported other students with their problems and helped them with their daily tasks. For my final project, I had to develop a project, and I proposed the idea of creating a platform for the Fellow Program. After receiving approval from DCI, we started developing a MERN stack-based platform.
<br />

# The final project was successfully completed and was very well received by DCI, to the extent that it was to be institutionalized. To further develop the project, DCI offered us a two-month mandatory internship, during which we continued optimizing the [Fellow Program Platform](https://fellow.digitalcareerinstitute.org/). During this time, I took on the role of a Junior Full-Stack Developer. The project idea digitized a manual process and became a company-wide tool for an international institution. Today, this platform allows DCI students to receive support more easily.
<br />

# During my training and previous professional experience, I have worked both independently and in teams to implement various web projects. I have gained hands-on experience in developing applications using HTML, SCSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, WordPress, as well as backend technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. Additionally, I am familiar with agile methodologies such as Scrum.
<br />

# A key aspect of my training and professional work has been independently solving problems in web development. I particularly value collaboration in interdisciplinary teams to develop innovative and efficient solutions.
<br />

# I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your company and am available for an interview at any time.
